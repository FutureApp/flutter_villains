## Villains for flutter. What are heroes without villains?

TK insert animated mock graphic




### What are villains

- Villains are a subtle que to the user about how the page is assembled.
- Villains go well with the hero, but are not exclusivly
- An easy to drop in widget to make everything look more pretty

### What villains are not

- hard to use
- A way to build very complex animations.
- Confusing people by adding more complexity


##### The animation duration of the villains is exactly the same as the page transition.

Villains work best with routes with no moving route transitions (like MaterialPageRoute or CupertinoPageRoute) because too many animations distract the user. Though they can also work with those when animation in the same direction:

## Features:
The villain framework takes care of:
- managing page transition callbacks
- supplying animations
- providing premade common animations

In contrast to real world villains, these villains are **very** easy to handle.





### Limitations
The route being push ontop of is not animating because it is not on the screen anymore.
